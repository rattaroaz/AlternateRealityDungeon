USAGE NOTES
===========

- Temporary potions stack with equipment bonuses but not with other temporary potions of the same type
- Permanent stat potions can exceed normal stat caps but cannot go above 255
- Multiple permanent potions of the same type can be consumed for cumulative effects
- Invisibility does not affect combat visibility (enemies can still target the invisible character)
- All potions are consumed upon use (one-time use items)
- Potion effects are applied immediately when consumed
- Temporary effects are tracked by game time and wear off after 1 hour

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
======================

Potions are integrated into the game's item system and can be used via the inventory (U key). Temporary potion effects are tracked in the player object and automatically removed when their duration expires. Permanent effects modify base stats directly.
